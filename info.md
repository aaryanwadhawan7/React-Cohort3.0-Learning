- Why do need React ? 

For static websites, you don't need React.
For dynamic websites, we need React.

- React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS, It's a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS.

- React -----[npm run build] -----> HTML/CSS/JS

- To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things => State & Components

- State -> An object that represents the current state of the app. It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change). For example, the value of the counter.
- Components -> How a DOM element should render, given a state. It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML dynamic snippet that changes given the state.
- A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulate when the state changes.
